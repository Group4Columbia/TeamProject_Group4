# TeamProject_Group4


### TOPIC: COVID 19 Machine Learning Analysis
In this team project, we will analyze the trend of COVID-19 dataset using machine learning technics. 
1.	Find out the correlation between # of test and the COVID-19 positive cases. 
    - More testing does not lead to more cases
2.	Find out the correlation between # of COVID-19 positive cases and # of death 
	  - More positive cases does not lead to more death
3.	Find out the correlation between # of vaccination and # of cases by county / state 
	  - More vaccination does not lead to less cases
4.	Find out if the most populated areas have the greatest amount of vaccinations  
	  - Vaccine rollout is not related to population
5.  Find out the relationship between days of school closures and cases in the community 
    - School closures does not decrease community cases

### Team project Environment Setup

- ![team members brach setup](https://github.com/Group4Columbia/TeamProject_Group4/blob/main/Capture_branch.JPG)

### Objectives
1.	Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following: 
a.	✓ Takes in data in from the provisional database 
b.	✓ Outputs label(s) for input data
2.	Data - Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following: 
a.	✓ Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema 
b.	✓ Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
