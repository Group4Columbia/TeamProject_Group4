# TeamProject_Group4


### TOPIC: COVID 19 Machine Learning Analysis
In this team project, we analyzed COVID-19 data for 2020 to predict its impact on outcomes in 2021. We analyzed current trends of COVID-19 dataset using numerous statistical calculations and python packages to displays trends and forecast/predict outcome based on collected data. 
1.  Find out the correlation between # of test and the COVID-19 positive cases. 
    - When more tests  are performed, we find more positive cases
2.  Find out the correlation between # of COVID-19 positive cases and # of death. 
    - More positive cases does not lead to more death
3.  Find out the correlation between # of vaccinations and Human Development Index. Also looking at how the Human Development Index affects total COVID cases
    - The higher the Human Development Index, the higher the amount of Vaccinations countries receive.
4.  Find out how the Human Devlopment Index effects the vaccination rollout across different countries that we are using for analysis. 
    - Vaccine rollout is effected by the Human Development Index, and other socioeconomic factors such as politcs. 
5.  Find out the relationship between days of school closures and cases in the country / region.
    - School closures does not decrease community cases

### Objectives
1.	Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following: 

	a.	✓ Takes in data in from the provisional database 

	b.	✓ Outputs label(s) for input data

2.	Data - Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following: 

	a.	✓ Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema 

	b.	✓ Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database

### Team Project Development Planning: 
1.	World Map displying trends
2.	Trend Analysis – Python technology
3.	Prediction Analysis: Machine Learning (Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models) 
4.	Final Report using Tableau to provide summary of visualizations 

### Conclusion
1. 	Both World and US Map - COVID-19 Map - Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center  - John Hopkins Data – on the Map
2.	Trend Analysis –Python technology
3.	Prediction Analysis: Machine Learning (Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models) - [Machine Learning School Closing & Covid 19 Cases](https://github.com/Group4Columbia/TeamProject_Group4/blob/main/School_Closure_Covid19_Human.ipynb)
4.	Final Report provide visual using Tableau
