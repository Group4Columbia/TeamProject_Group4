# TeamProject_Group4


### TOPIC: COVID 19 Machine Learning Analysis
In this team project, we will analyze the trend of COVID-19 dataset using machine learning technics. 
1.	Find out the correlation between # of test and the COVID-19 positive cases.
2.	Find out the correlation between # of COVID-19 positive cases and # of death
3.	Find out the correlation between # of vaccination and # of test by county / state
4.	Find out where the most vaccinations and test by geographic location 
5.  Find out the effectiveness of lockdowns and travel restrictions

### Team project Environment Setup
- Team Github – https://github.com/Group4Columbia/TeamProject_Group4
- Main 
- Branch (per each) 
- ![team members brach setup](https://github.com/Group4Columbia/TeamProject_Group4/blob/main/Capture_branch.JPG)

### Objectives
1.	Team members present a provisional machine learning model that stands in for the final machine learning model and accomplishes the following: 
a.	✓ Takes in data in from the provisional database 
b.	✓ Outputs label(s) for input data
2.	Data - Team members present a provisional database that stands in for the final database and accomplishes the following: 
a.	✓ Sample data that mimics the expected final database structure or schema 
b.	✓ Draft machine learning module is connected to the provisional database
