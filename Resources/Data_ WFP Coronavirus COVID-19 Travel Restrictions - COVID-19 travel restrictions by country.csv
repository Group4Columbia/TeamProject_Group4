*Transiting Australia: The Department of Home Affairs <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/transiting-australia"">website</a> sets out information on transiting Australia, including on transit visas. There are currently restrictions on transits due to coronavirus.
You’re able to transit through Australia if transiting for 72 hours or less and you have evidence of onward international travel. If you intend to spend longer than 72 hours in Australia waiting for your connecting flight, you’re not considered to be transiting, and will need to request an exemption from the Australian Border Force Commissioner.
Due to COVID-19 related border restrictions, you can usually only travel to Australia to transit to another country if your connecting flight leaves from the same airport.
State quarantine requirements remain in place, and airport operating hours vary. This may limit how long you can stay in the airport, and whether you need to apply for exemption from Australia’s 14-day quarantine arrangements issued by the relevant State health authority. You should check with your airline, as well as on State and Territory <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/about-us/contact-us/local-state-and-territory-health-departments"">websites</a>for the latest details and how to apply.
All airports should allow passengers to remain in the airport if your transit is less than 8 hours and on the same day. You must remain airside and you will not be able to pass customs (even to collect your baggage). You will need to maintain social distancing, cough etiquette and hand hygiene. At your first point of departure, you will need to have checked your baggage through to your final destination.
If you have to leave the airport you will be taken on arrival in Australia to a designated quarantine facility by Australian authorities. You will need to remain there until proceeding to the airport for your departing flight. You may need to pay for quarantine - you should check State and Territory <a href=""https://www.health.gov.au/news/health-alerts/novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov-health-alert/coronavirus-covid-19-advice-for-travellers"">website</a> for details on quarantine.

*Leaving Australia: You should check the Department of Home Affairs website for information on leaving Australia, including whether you need an exemption.
The Australian authorities continue to advise international visitors to leave Australia where possible due to the COVID-19 situation.

Dual Australian/British nationals and permanent residents in Australia are not generally permitted to leave Australia unless they qualify for an exemption. If you meet an exemption category or have a have a compelling or compassionate reason to travel overseas, you need to apply for an exemption in advance from the Commissioner of the Australian Border Force. You should do this as early as possible - at least 48 hours before your intended departure time.
Details on categories for exemptions, the exemption application form, and the evidence you must provide to support your exemption application, can be found on the Department of Home Affairs <a href=""https://covid19.homeaffairs.gov.au/leaving-australia"">website</a>.
If you’re a British/Australian dual national or permanent resident who is ordinarily resident in a country outside Australia and have spent more time in the last 12 to 24 months outside Australia than within it, you do not need an exemption to leave Australia. You should be ready to show evidence that you normally reside outside Australia if requested by authorities on departure at the airport.

This exclusion does not apply to temporary foreign workers, most international students, Canadian citizens and permanent residents or their immediate and extended families provided they remain in Canada for 15 days or more. Anyone arriving in Canada must self-quarantine for 14 days, and have a credible self-isolation plan.

Documentation of a negative laboratory test result must be presented to the airline prior to coming to Canada. The test must be performed using a COVID-19 molecular test within 72 hours of boarding a flight to Canada. Passengers without a negative test will be denied boarding. If you are travelling from a country where molecular testing is unavailable you will be required to report to a designated Public Health Agency of Canada quarantine facility for the duration of your mandatory 14-day quarantine. Delays in obtaining test results does not apply. <br>

*Travel in Chile: If you are travelling to the airport to catch a flight from one of the areas under quarantine or curfew, presenting your passport and boarding pass will permit you to cross any checkpoints. Use a recognised taxi service or airport transfer whose driver should have the requisite permissions. The government has introduced a special holiday permit (Permiso de vacaciones) (until 31 March 2021) for residents in comunas in ‘Transition’ or Stage 2. This does not apply to tourists or non-resident foreign nationals, only to Chileans and foreign residents. For more information, please see the <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/pasoapaso/"">official Chilean advice</a> . Chilean authorities require the use of face masks in all public spaces / public transport, including the airport. You risk a significant fine for not wearing a mask in public. Quarantine orders and sanitary cordons are in place in Santiago and in other parts of the country. There is currently a nationwide curfew (between 22:00- 0500, seven days a week).<br>
Be aware that if you wish to travel to Magallanes Region, you will need to provide proof of a negative PCR-test result given within 72 hours prior to travel. Chile is deploying a flexible approach to bringing municipal areas (called comunas) in and out of quarantine/sanitary cordons. New measures can be announced by the government at any time and come into force shortly after, although changes are typically announced every Wednesday and are applied from Fridays onwards. On 28 July, local areas (“comunas”) in Chile that were under lockdown, as part of the Chilean government’s 5stage plan, began to move from quarantine (Stage 1) into less restrictive stages. The rules on mobility in each stage are as follows: <br>
Stage 1: Quarantine. Restricted mobility; permits required for essential activity; Evening curfew from 10pmto 5am, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75, except on Mondays, Thursdays and Saturdays between 10am and midday or between 4pm and 6pm; prohibition of movement to secondary home. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from 7am to 8:30am every day. <br>
Stage 2: Transition. Quarantine remains in place at weekends and bank holidays; social gatherings of no more than 5 people allowed inside; Evening curfew from 10pm to 5am, social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place; obligatory quarantine for those over 75; and a prohibition on movement to other regions.. You are allowed to travel to other regions or ‘comunas’ only with a special holiday permit. Outdoor exercise activities are allowed from 7am to 8:30am only from Monday to Friday. <br>
Stage 3: Preparation. Under this stage there are no mobility restrictions within the comuna; social gatherings capped at 15 people; Evening curfew from 10am to 5am., social distancing and cordon sanitaire in place;; and interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3, 4 and 5. You require a special holiday permit if you are travelling to a secondary home located in a region in Stage 2. In/Outdoor activities are allowed. <br>
Stage 4: Initial opening. Significant step that aims to re-open certain low risk activities and to avoid crowds and physical contact. Establishment of a new way of living: COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 30 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 25% capacity; restaurants and cafés allowed to open to the public at 25% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments (Education Ministry plans and health situation permitting). Evening curfew from 10pmto 5am.; social distancing still required; pubs and clubs remain closed; over 75’s allowed to leave their homes for 60 minutes per day;. Interregional travel is only allowed to regions in Stage 3, 4 and 5. You require a special holiday permit if you are travelling to a secondary home located on a region in Stage 2. <br>
Stage 5: Advanced opening. This step relies on the population becoming accustomed to activities in COVID MODE. Social gatherings with no more than 150 people permitted; cinemas, theatres, restaurants and cafes allowed to function at 75% capacity; gyms, pubs and clubs can function at 50% capacity; gradual return to physical classes in education establishments. Social distancing of 1 metre; free movement for those over 75 and movement to secondary homes allowed. <br>
The Government’s <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/pasoapaso/"">‘Paso a Paso’ website</a>
 outlines which phase-out stage each comuna of Chile is under the heading (‘Situación Comunal’).
In areas in quarantine you are only allowed to leave your residence under certain circumstances, including for medical reasons, basic services, and public services. If you need to leave your residence for food supplies or medical reasons, you must get a permit from the <a href=""https://comisariavirtual.cl/"">Comisaria Virtual</a>. Foreigners may use their passport number to access the system. The pages are only in Spanish. <br>
The government has introduced a special holiday permit (until 31 March 2021) for residents in comunas in ‘Transition’ or Stage 2. This does not apply to tourists or non-resident foreign nationals, only to Chileans and foreign residents. For more information, please see the <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/pasoapaso/"">official Chilean advice</a>.<br>

 (“pasaporte sanitario”) (under “viajeros regionales” for residents or “viajeros regionales” for foreign visitors), at least 24 hours before.<br>
Information on the areas of Chile that have sanitary cordons is available on the Government’s <a href=""https://www.gob.cl/coronavirus/plandeaccion/"">‘Plan de Acción’</a>.
Checkpoints for health inspections are in force at various points around Santiago and elsewhere. In addition to checking the health of persons passing through, these checkpoints will be used to confirm that specific individuals who have been ordered to quarantine by medical authorities are not violating their quarantine. You will need to get a <a href=""https://www.c19.cl/"">“Health Passport”</a> prior to travel and present it at any checkpoint.<br>
*Public places and services: Chilean authorities require the use of face masks in all public spaces, irrespective of what stage of the quarantine phase-out a comuna is in.

*Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19). *Entry and transit: You will need a valid visa to enter China. The Chinese Visa Application Centres in London and Belfast are closed until further notice. The Application centres in Manchester and Edinburgh will be closed from 27 December until further notice.<br>
The Chinese authorities have suspended all direct flights from the UK. This measure will be subject to review but no date has been announced. Restrictions on travel to China from other countries, and the necessary requirements, may be different. British nationals travelling to China from a third country should follow the directions on the website of the local Chinese Embassy or consulate for requirements from that country. <br>
On 4 November the Chinese Embassy in the UK announced the temporary suspension of entry into China by non-Chinese nationals in the UK holding Chinese visas or residence permits. Entry by holders of diplomatic, service, courtesy or C visas would not be affected. Foreign nationals visiting China for emergencies can still apply for visas at Chinese Embassies or Consulates and entry by non-Chinese nationals in the UK with visas issued after 3 November 2020 will not be affected. <br>
If you’re issued a visa to travel from the UK to China in these circumstances you will need to submit a Health Declaration Form to your nearest Chinese Embassy or Consulate in the UK before you travel, who will need to certify your form and return it to you via email. The Chinese Embassy announcement of 4 November stated the Chinese Embassy and Consulates have suspended issuing Certified Health Declaration forms for non-Chinese nationals in the UK holding visas or residence permits. More details, including the process for submitting forms for those still eligible, can be found on the <a href=""http://www.chinese-embassy.org.uk/eng/visa/notice/t1806517.htm"">Chinese Embassy website</a>. <br>
In order to receive a Health Declaration Form from the Chinese Embassy you must provide evidence of negative nucleic acid and IgM antibody tests for COVID-19 taken no more than 48 hours before you travel. <br>
Reports of both your nucleic acid (COVID-19) and IgM (antibody) tests must come from the same service provider. This does not mean the provider must carry out both tests, but that the provider must guarantee both test reports. You should arrange to take a private test. <br>
A limited number of international flights from other countries are flying into Beijing. Other international passenger flights to Beijing continue to be diverted to 16 designated airports in Chengdu, Changsha, Hefei, Lanzhou, Tianjin, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, Jinan, Qingdao, Nanjing, Shenyang, Dalian, Zhengzhou, Xi’an and Wuhan. A small number of international flights are also operating direct between European cities and Shanghai, Guangzhou and Qingdao. <br>
*Health checks on arrival: All overseas passenger arrivals are subject to health checks on arrival (likely involving nucleic acid or swab tests). Those failing health checks may be sent to a designated hospital for treatment. Health regulations surrounding passengers arriving from overseas are continuously changing. You should contact the Chinese Embassy in your country before you travel if you have any questions regarding these entry requirements, quarantine rules or the requirements for individual cities. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Following health checks on arrival, you will then need to enter quarantine for at least 14 days. At some points of entry children 14 and over will be required to quarantine alone irrespective of whether they test positive or negative for COVID.
You will be separated from your child if one of you tests positive for coronavirus. If this happens to you, you can call +86 (0)10 8529 6600 for 24/7 urgent consular assistance. Non-residents may be charged for their care. For further information on healthcare in China, please see the <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/coronavirus"">Coronavirus section</a>. <br>
Quarantine is usually spent at either a centralised government hotel (with costs covered by the traveller) or your home. Quarantine requirements can change at short notice and may differ from province to province. <br>
Follow-up swab tests are likely to take place during your quarantine period. Family members of someone who tests positive, or those who have been in close contact, will need to go into a government quarantine hospital. For all quarantine arrangements in China: <br>
•        unless directed by the authorities you’re not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 14 days. This means you’re also unable to leave China for the duration of the quarantine<br>
•        depending on the quarantine location, facilities may be basic: there may be no fridge, no air-conditioning, and limited or no internet/wifi<br>
•        during your stay you will be responsible for cleaning the room<br>
•        if meals are not available at the quarantine location, you will need to arrange food orders for delivery from outside<br>
•        larger sized families with two parents may be separated into 2 rooms. <br>
•        if you’re on prescription medication make sure you bring enough with you to last for at least 3-4 weeks together with medical documents certifying that you need to take this medication. See <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/china/health"">Health</a>  for further information.<br>
Failure to comply with the quarantine conditions or testing put in place, or any attempts to deliberately conceal health conditions can result in being sentenced to up to three years in prison. This applies to both Chinese and foreign nationals.

 <br>
 <br> 
 Internal Restrictions: 
*Travel in China: Mandatory requirements to check temperatures and use health apps or scan QR codes to prove travel history are in place at transport hubs, hotels, commercial buildings including restaurants, residential compounds and other locations – such locations are also increasingly needing the use of ‘health kit code’ apps to demonstrate health condition and travel history. <br>
Restrictions on movement and quarantine arrangements remain for travel between different parts of the country. Some cities and provinces need travellers from high to medium risk areas to undergo 14 days of isolation in their place of residence or in centralised observation. Quarantine is enforced at the neighbourhood level and procedures vary, so check in advance. <br>
The possibility that local authorities impose mandatory quarantine in response to fresh outbreaks is high. There have been reports of individuals who have frequented bars or restaurants where there have been confirmed cases of COVID-19 being mandated to undergo 14 days of centralised quarantine. You should keep up to date with the latest developments and this travel advice. <br>
There have been reports of discrimination against foreign nationals in China as a result of a perceived risk that they might re-import COVID-19. In Guangzhou, in particular, there have been reports of discrimination on the basis of ethnicity, especially of those who are black and minority ethnic, including additional enforced quarantine and testing, as well as hotels and businesses not serving clients.

International Restrictions: Entry rules in response to coronavirus (COVID-19).  
*Entry to Ecuador: All land borders with Colombia and Peru remain closed until further notice. However, Ecuadorean nationals and foreign residents may be allowed to enter Ecuador, via Rumichaca and Huaquillas northern and southern borders. All ports remain closed.
As of 1 June 2020, international commercial flights have resumed operations to and from Ecuador. However, following the identification of a new variant of Coronavirus, we highly recommend you to contact your airline/travel company to check your travel itinerary. <br>
*Testing / screening on arrival: Upon arrival, all passengers will be required to sign a declaration form with their itinerary and local contact details. They must also present a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19, taken up to 10 days prior to their arrival in the country. This is a mandatory requirement, which airlines are responsible for enforcing in order to allow passengers to board. You should arrange to take a private test.
In countries where the PCR tests are not available, passengers must agree to take a COVID-19 test at the airport in Ecuador on arrival, at their expense. Airline crew members are exempt from the PCR test requirement. Antigen tests (rapid test) will be randomly carried out, by the Ministry of Health (MSP), on passengers arriving in Ecuador by air, sea or land. This test will be provided by the MSP. As of 13 January 2021, the only passengers officially exempted from the random rapid tests are airline crew members and children under 14 years old.<br>
If you test positive in the antigen test, you will need to self-isolate for 10 days. Non-residents of Ecuador will have to self-isolate in specific <a href=""https://www.salud.gob.ec/aislamiento-preventivo-obligatorio-apo-documentos-normativos-covid19/"">hotels</a> as determined by the local authorities and at their own expense. Residents can isolate in their home. If on arrival a passenger presents COVID-19 related symptoms, despite their antigen test result, they will be evaluated by a health care worker and if needed will be taken to the nearest health centre for a full evaluation.<br>
*Quarantine requirements: Passengers who test positive in the antigen test taken at the airport will need to self-isolate for 10 days. Self-isolation for non-residents must be carried out in specified <a href=""https://www.salud.gob.ec/aislamiento-preventivo-obligatorio-apo-documentos-normativos-covid19/"">hotels</a>. Local residents and people qualified as “priority attention groups” such as people over 65 years old, children and pregnant women, will be allowed to self-isolate at their homes.
The Ministry of Health has published <a href=""https://coronavirusecuador.com/"">more information on coronavirus protocols</a>
  that also allows for direct messaging with the Ministry (Spanish only).
If you need to find emergency accommodation to go through the mandatory self-isolation protocol, you can access options on the <a href=""https://www.salud.gob.ec/aislamiento-preventivo-obligatorio-apo-documentos-normativos-covid19/"">Ministry of Health website</a>. The Government will monitor the situation in other countries with high risk of contagion to prevent incoming flights.<br>
*Travel to and from the Galapagos: From 1 July, tourist activities are allowed in the Galapagos Islands. Commercial flights connecting the Islands resumed on 3 August. The local authorities have created a ‘safe travel corridor’ for travel to the Galapagos Islands. Foreigners wishing to enter the islands must present a negative Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19, taken 96 hours prior to the date of departure to the Galapagos islands. On arrival in Ecuador tourists may be requested to take another PCR test, at their own expense. Tourists must also present a return flight and a safe passage document (‘salvoconducto’) issued by the Ministry of Tourism to be exempt from doing 14 days of self-isolation on the islands. The tour operators or hotels are responsible for arranging this safe passage document on behalf of tourists, given that visitors are required to have previous contracted travel and accommodation arrangements. The Galapagos Transit Control Card, will need to be filled out online at least 24 hours before the flight. On arrival in Ecuador you will be required to fill in a Health Status Declaration, including a local address. Travel health insurance is mandatory for foreign tourists.<br>
If you have any queries regarding travel back to mainland Ecuador, you can contact the Galapagos authorities via email at galapagosresponder@gmail.com

Any person that tests positive for COVID-19 will be prohibited from entering Ethiopia. Anyone with a pre-existing condition that requires regular medicines should bring sufficient amounts to cover a potential unplanned additional 2 week stay. 
Measures are in place when arriving into the country across land borders. Those crossing with a negative RT PCR COVID-19 test certificate dated within the previous 120 hours (5 days) will be screened for symptoms and required to self-isolate at home for 7 days. Those that do not present a negative test certificate will be screened and required to self-isolate for 14 days. Only PCR tests will be accepted.

Children travelling alone will also need to quarantine for 21 days on arrival in a designated hotel. It is down to hotel policy whether a child can self-isolate alone. Further details can be found on the Hong Kong SAR government’s website and you should call the Port Heath Division (+852 3904 9333) to understand the latest requirements if your child is travelling alone. For up-to-date advice on entry requirements and restrictions, please visit the <a href=""https://www.coronavirus.gov.hk/eng/inbound-travel.html"">Hong Kong SAR government’s website</a>.
For all quarantine arrangements in Hong Kong:
•        you’re not allowed to leave your designated quarantine location for 21 days. This means you’re also unable to leave Hong Kong for the duration of the quarantine

*Humanitarian workers deploying to Liberia:  If you are deploying to Liberia for a period of less than 15 days you should contact your organisation for advice on which rules to follow. If you are deploying to Liberia for a period of 15-60 days, you should follow a different process: •        The organisation that is deploying you should inform the chair or co-chair of the COVID-19 Incident Management System (IMS) in advance of your proposed deployment, of the purpose of your deployment, the area of deployment, exact location you will stay, and contact details while in Liberia; •        You must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours of testing (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia);  •        You must self-isolate for 7 days, beginning the day after arrival in Liberia.

Sample collection involves taking a swab of the inside of your nose and the back of your throat, using a long cotton bud, for PCR testing. Sample processing could take several days. See Testing on departure for information on test locations;  •        If your PCR test result is negative, you can proceed with your deployment. If your PCR test is positive, you will be subject to Liberia’s case management guidelines. This means NPHIL will consider on a case-by-case basis and you may be taken to a government COVID-19 treatment unit. Private health care facilities are not currently permitted to treat COVID-19 patients. Home-based care is considered on a case-by-case basis. <br>
Exemptions to PCR testing on arrival: •        Children under the age of 5 years old are exempt from COVID-19 testing and do not require a test result certificate;  •        Cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers with layovers less than 48 hours are exempt from testing if they complete pre-boarding testing as per their airline’s policy and comply with screening procedures while in Liberia. They must complete screening on arrival and proceed to their designated flight crew hotel. If layover is more than 48 hours, cabin crew, captains, flight engineers and first officers must undergo PCR testing before leaving Liberia (see Testing on departure);  •        Diplomats and their families, honorary consuls, duly accredited international organisations’ staff and Liberian diplomats must present a negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate from an accredited lab within 96 hours of testing (i.e. your test sample must have been collected a maximum of 4 days before arrival in Liberia). Alternatively, voluntary testing at the airport is available free of charge. If you do not present a valid negative PCR COVID-19 test result certificate, NPHIL staff will seek to test you on arrival. You should be prepared for travel restrictions, and changes to screening and quarantine requirements with no advance notice. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Depending on the length and reason for you visit, you may not have to isolate on arrival. However, for the majority of travellers Liberia recommends self-isolation for 7 days after arrival. Humanitarian works staying longer than 15 days will need to isolate on arrival for 7 days and then take a further PCR test. There is a risk for British nationals of being put into a government quarantine or medical facility, either on arrival or during your trip to Liberia. Liberian precautionary observation centre (POCs) are basic, and not guaranteed to meet Public Health England standards. You are at risk of being put into quarantine or instructed to self-isolate even after completing your post-arrival self-isolation, if you develop symptoms (fever, cough or respiratory illness), or it is suspected you have been in contact with some who has tested positive for coronavirus. If you test positive for COVID-19, you may be transferred to a government quarantine facility or treatment centre. You are strongly advised to familiarise yourself with these risks before travelling. <br>
If you are travelling on behalf of government, an international organisation/NGO or a company, you should check with your organisation whether they have pre-arranged a private POC, i.e. quarantine facility, authorised by NHPIL. The British Embassy cannot provide POC facilities. If you show symptoms, you may be transferred to a government POC or treatment centre. Visitors arriving on a laissez-passer (except UN or EU), may also be taken to quarantine for secondary screening. Any suspicion of illegal attempts to circumvent the process will result in removal to quarantine. <br>

For exemptions, see Exemptions to PCR testing on departure. •        You must present a negative COVID-19 PCR test result, from a test conducted by Liberia’s National Public Health Reference Laboratory within 72 hours of departure;  •        COVID-19 testing is available at the Union Center, located in Sophia, Congo Town, Monrovia from 9am to 4 pm 7 days per week.

 International Restrictions: 
*Entry to Myanmar: The government of Myanmar has suspended all international commercial passenger flights from any of its airports until 28 February 2021 at the earliest. It will then review the situation. Residents of the UK, or those who have visited the UK within the previous 14 days, are currently unable to enter Myanmar. Those not travelling from the United Kingdom, including British Nationals, should check the requirements for travel from that country to Myanmar with the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate. If you are on a flight transiting via the UK, you will only be allowed to enter Myanmar if your transit time was for six hours or fewer. This is subject to short notice changes. Prior to travel you should check with the nearest Myanmar Embassy. New tourist visa applications are currently suspended. At present Myanmar authorities can offer business visas to foreign nationals with a compelling case. You or your employer must make your case to your nearest Myanmar Embassy and obtain permission. These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. <br>
*Testing/Screening on arrival: There are temperature checks for all arrivals. Arrivals must provide evidence of a negative COVID-19 test result. Testing requirements ahead of entry to Myanmar are subject to change. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure. <br>
*Quarantine requirements: Arrivals in Myanmar must enter government-arranged quarantine. You will be allotted your quarantine facility on arrival. You may have no choice but will be placed in the same government quarantine facility or hotel as all the other people on your flight. You will be provided with food, for which you will be charged. The exact length of your quarantine will depend on your travel history. You should confirm your quarantine requirements with the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate before you travel. Those arriving in Myanmar may need to abide by the following quarantine requirements: 
•        complete 7 days home quarantine prior to the date of travel. This must be verified by an employer’s or doctor’s declaration, or a self-declaration. During these 7 days you may only leave your place of quarantine to take a COVID test;
•        provide evidence of a negative COVID test result;
•        complete 7 days quarantine in a government facility or government approved hotel on arrival in Myanmar (allocated on arrival);
•        undertake a COVID test after 7 days (through the National Health Laboratory, at a cost is MMK 200,000). If you test negative, you must complete a further 7 days of home quarantine, and will then be able to leave quarantine. If you test positive, you will be transferred to a designated government hospital for COVID patients. You will need to remain for 28 days in hospital, after which you can leave if you have tested negative for COVID for two consecutive weeks prior.
These rules are subject to change at short notice, and the government of Myanmar can extend quarantine periods for a number of reasons, even for those who have been granted permission to undergo a shorter quarantine period. This includes if any person on a flight you might have used tests positive for COVID-19, or in response to the situation in a country you might have recently visited. You may be required to do more than one COVID-19 test before you leave quarantine, even if you test negative.
If hospitalised with coronavirus, patients are obliged to use a government facility even if they have private insurance. Patients in government hospitals are generally expected to make their own arrangements for bringing in food and other essential supplies. Lone travellers will not be allowed out of isolation to buy food or make phone calls. These arrangements are subject to change and at short notice. Confirmation should be sought from the relevant Myanmar Embassy or Consulate well in advance of your departure. <br>
*Data collection: Arrivals will be expected to provide contact details. We are not aware of any requirement to download an app.
 <br>
 <br>
 Internal Restrictions: *Travel in Myanmar: A limited schedule of domestic flights is operating, though the rules for access to these is not clear. You are advised to stay home at night, and minimise movement during the day, avoiding crowds. If you do still attempt to travel domestically, please note that you may encounter checkpoints on your journey. Prior to recent events, those taking a domestic flight inside Myanmar needed to take a COVID-19 test no more than 36 hours prior to departure. You may still be required to quarantine on arrival at your destination, particularly if you are coming from an area under a ‘Stay at Home’ order. You should contact individual airlines for details, and should comply with all the relevant guidance and regulations while travelling.<br>
In some areas there may be local requirements for visitors from other parts of the country, including the requirement to take a COVID-19 test in advance of travel, and to quarantine on arrival. You should check with local authorities for information on possible local preventative measures.<br>
The majority of townships in Yangon are currently under a ‘Stay at Home’ order. Coco Island Region, Seikkyi/Khanaungto, Twantay, and Kwangyangon are not under a ‘Stay at Home’ order.<br>
The rules for Yangon townships under a ‘Stay at Home’ order state that residents should stay in their own homes. Only one person per household is allowed to go out for essential supplies, or two people can leave the home to visit a hospital or clinic. Only the driver and one passenger can travel in a car at the same time, unless travelling to a hospital or clinic, in which case, there can be two passengers. Those who work in ‘essential private services’ are excluded from this order. Essential private services are defined by the government of Myanmar as banks, financial services, petrol stations, livestock and refrigeration industries, production and distribution of pharmaceutical products, production and distribution of drinking water and personal items. A curfew from 8pm until 4am each day is currently in effect in Yangon and other cities across Myanmar.<br>
Other parts of Myanmar are also under ‘Stay at Home’ orders. You should confirm with the local ward administrator if you are unsure whether an area is subject to a ‘Stay at Home’ order. Anyone wishing to travel to or from an area subject to a ‘Stay at Home’ order may need to contact the relevant local authorities to confirm the requirements for travel.<br>

If you are outside of Myanmar, you should refer to your nearest Myanmar Embassy.<br>
Since 13 May it has been compulsory for anyone going out in public in Myanmar to wear a facemask. Failure to wear one will result in a fine. This requirement is being enforced strictly and has led to the arrest of some offenders.<br>
It is recommended that foreigners carry:<br>

•        Form C (immigration document)<br>

Some hotels have reopened but many tourist resorts remain closed.<br>
*Public places and services: Some restaurants, bars and shops have reopened with temperature checks and social distancing measures in place.

All travellers to New Zealand (except those coming from Australia, Antarctica and most Pacific Islands) will be required to have confirmation of a negative COVID-19 PCR test result in the 72 hours prior to departure. This will come into force on flights arriving in New Zealand after 11:59pm (local time) on 25 January. New Zealand citizens and residents returning to New Zealand may travel to New Zealand and do not need any formal exemption.
There are a small number of additional, limited exceptions to the ban on travelling to and entering New Zealand. The following people should seek approval from Immigration New Zealand (INZ) using the limited exceptions process:
•        partners, dependent children (aged 24 years and under) and legal guardians of New Zealand citizens and residents; 
•        Australian citizens and permanent residents who normally live in New Zealand; 
•        essential health workers; 
•        other essential workers who are specifically agreed to by the New Zealand government;
•        Samoan and Tongan citizens making essential travel;

*Quarantine requirements:  Anyone entering New Zealand needs to undergo quarantine or managed isolation in an approved facility for a minimum of 14 days. Arrivals must then test negative for COVID-19 before entering the community.
Anyone travelling to New Zealand will be required to have a COVID-19 test on ‘day zero’, i.e. within 24 hours of arrival in a managed isolation and quarantine facility. Arrivals must remain in their managed isolation or quarantine facility room until the results of the test is known. You will then undergo further testing on Day 3 and Day 12 as required for all arrivals, in line with New Zealand’s policy on isolation and quarantine. Travellers to New Zealand will need to register on the Managed Isolation Allocation System as the first step to securing their place in a managed isolation facility. Before you book your flights, you need to register for a voucher for managed isolation. Your voucher allocates you a place in a managed isolation facility.
For more information see <a href=""https://www.miq.govt.nz/travel-to-new-zealand/secure-your-place-in-managed-isolation/"">Secure your place in managed isolation</a>. Provision of a voucher for managed isolation does not guarantee entry into New Zealand. You must first ensure you qualify to enter the country under New Zealand’s border restrictions. You can apply for your MIQ voucher up to 3 months in advance. Space in managed isolation is extremely limited over the Christmas and New Year period and the New Zealand government is asking prospective travellers to regularly check the <a href=""https://allocation.miq.govt.nz/portal/"">Managed Isolation Allocation System</a> website for preferred dates. There are a few exceptional circumstances in which people can apply for an exemption from managed isolation. Visit the <a href=""https://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/diseases-and-conditions/covid-19-novel-coronavirus/covid-19-current-situation/covid-19-border-controls"">New Zealand Ministry of Health website</a> for more information.

 Internal Restrictions:
*Travel in the Philippines: Measures have been introduced by the Philippine government to prevent the spread of coronavirus; these differ across the country. The National Capital Region (Metro Manila), Cordillera Administrative Region, the provinces of Batangas and Davao del Norte and the cities of Tacloban, Davao City and Iligan are subject to General Community Quarantine (GCQ) measures. The rest of the Philippines is under Modified General Community Quarantine (MGCQ). However, changes can be made at short notice so you should monitor the status in your local area.<br>
Non-essential travel, including for tourist purposes, is now permitted between GCQ and MGCQ regions. There may be entry requirements imposed from region to region so you should check with the relevant local authority. Metro Manila is currently subject to a curfew from midnight to 4am with the exception of Navotas City which has curfew hours of 8pm to 4am. Some cities are imposing age restrictions on people permitted to leave their residence for non-essential reasons. These vary by region so you should familiarise yourself with the requirements in your local area.<br>
The wearing of face shields while on public and private transport is now mandatory. This includes but is not limited to trains, buses, jeepneys, taxis, boats and ships. The order also includes aeroplanes. You should check with your airline in advance whether they will provide a shield or whether you need to bring your own.<br>
You should closely monitor announcements from local authorities to understand the latest restrictions and regulations where you’re situated, and their impact on your ability to travel and access essential services. Check the requirements of your local authority such as barangay clearance, health certificate or travel authority for any travel outside of your residence, including to the airport.

*Travel to the airport: Since November 2020, some airports including Ninoy Aquino International Airport (NAIA) have required passengers to download the ‘Traze Contact Tracing’ app prior to entry. You can find further information on the <a href="""">NAIA facebook page</a>.<br>
If you plan to take a commercial flight but are experiencing difficulty travelling to the airport due to community quarantine restrictions, the British Embassy can provide a letter to facilitate your passage through checkpoints. You can submit your request to our Consular team via the web <a href="""">contact form</a>. You can also seek assistance from your local <a href="""">Department of Tourism office</a>, which may be able to offer advice on transport options or hotels.<br>
The Philippine government has confirmed that foreign nationals will be able to leave the Philippines at any time during the period of enhanced quarantine. See <a href=""https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/philippines/entry-requirements"">Entry requirements</a>. There is disruption to travel routes both domestically and across the region.

See the Samoan Health Advisory <a href=""https://www.health.gov.ws/"">website</a> for further details, including a list of other countries from where entry will be denied.
The Samoan government announced that, with effect from 26 March 2020, all international travel to and from Samoa by plane will cease until further notice.
All international cruise ships and yachts will not be granted entry into Samoa.
Some countries in the region have also introduced travel restrictions to and from the Pacific islands. You should check specifics for any countries that might be involved in your travel when planning a trip to and/or from Samoa.
In this context, all travellers from outside of New Zealand must spend 28 days in New Zealand before onward travel to Samoa and must comply with all requirements. All passengers entering Samoa from New Zealand will be quarantined for 14 days at a designated facility.
*Testing/Screening on arrival: Travellers from New Zealand need: to complete the Health Declaration Card in flight; to have a COVID-19 test within three days before arrival; and to undergo a medical examination by a Registered Medical Practitioner within three days before arrival.
You will not be permitted to board the plane if you have a positive COVID-19 test or a COVID-19 test has not been done. Additionally, you will not be allowed to board if you have any of the following symptoms: cough; fever; sore throat; or flu-like symptoms.
All travellers need to present a hard copy of a COVID-19 test and medical report on arrival to health officers. Failure can result in denial of entry, with individuals returned to the point of departure before Samoa.
*Quarantine requirements: You will be quarantined for 14 days upon arrival into Samoa at a designated location. You must bring your own personal necessities, such as soap, tooth brush, toothpaste, to last for the 14 days of quarantine. Passengers are advised to check in 1 piece of luggage (max 20 kgs) when boarding. If you have any known medical conditions, please ensure you have enough medication to last for 2 months and inform relevant officials on arrival. You’re not allowed to bring alcohol into the quarantine site or allowed to consume any alcohol. Passengers who are on special diets will be responsible to pay for their own special dietary needs. You need to wear a face mask at all times and advised to maintain social distancing in flight.
Whilst in quarantine the cost of accommodation, breakfast and lunch for passengers should be borne by the Samoan government, but dinner will be the passenger’s responsibility. All children and infants less than 18 years must be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian. Parents must ensure all immunisations are up to date. Parents/legal guardians travelling with children must ensure sufficient supplies of basic needs while in quarantine, such as diapers, wipes, formula. A family member must travel with passengers having chronic medical conditions, the elderly and those with special needs. There are penalties if the conditions of the quarantine are breached.
*Travel via Australia or New Zealand: The government of Australia has announced that from 9pm Australia Eastern Standard Time on 20 March 2020, entry to the country will only be permitted to Australian citizens or permanent residents. This follows a similar announcement by New Zealand from 19 March 2020.

Public transport, including bus and ferry services, have now resumed a normal schedule, apart from on Sundays when no services will operate.<br>
*Accommodation: Accommodation, including hotels and private rentals, is available in Samoa, though certain requirements may be applicable.<br>
*Public places and services: The Samoan government announced on 10 June 2021 that it was further relaxing restrictions brought in to limit the spread of COVID-19. Under the new restrictions, some gatherings such as church services, village meetings, and non-contact sport events are permitted, with social distancing measures of 2 meters in place. Markets have been allowed to reopen, although street vendors remain prohibited from selling on footpaths. Restaurants and entertainment venues have also been allowed to reopen at reduced capacity, due to social distancing rules. A ban on most gatherings and public activities remains in place on Sundays.

 <br>
 International Restrictons: 
*Entry to Slovakia: There are travel restrictions for travellers from the UK and most other countries. Direct flights from the UK are permitted, but services are extremely limited. From 1 January 2021, only those UK nationals who are resident in Slovakia, close relatives of residents, close relatives of Slovak citizens, commercial transport personnel, students studying in Slovakia or those falling under certain limited exemptions may enter the country if they arrive directly from the UK or any other non-Schengen country. The above restriction does not apply for UK nationals who enter Slovakia via the land borders with Hungary, Austria, Czech Republic or Poland, or who fly from any country in the Schengen area.
If you travel to Slovakia, you must comply with the following requirements and failure to do so may incur a fine of up to 5,000 euros:
•    You must register in advance of travel on the Slovak government’s <a href=""https://korona.gov.sk/en/ehranica/"">website</a> and carry the confirmation with you during your stay, in case the authorities ask to see it.
•    If you arrive in Slovakia by air, you also need to complete the Slovak government’s <a href=""https://www.mindop.sk/covid/forms/edit/04b7d5cf32c7301bcafd8e55f2db5443bd5c"">Passenger Locator Form</a>. You should carry a printed confirmation with you in case the airline or border officials ask to see it.
•    You must enter a 14-day period of self-isolation immediately after arrival. If you are self-isolating at a private residence, anyone living in the same household must also self-isolate.
•    The authorities will contact you no earlier than the 8th day of your self-isolation to arrange a free RT-PCR test for COVID-19.
•    You must also inform your doctor in Slovakia about your self-isolation. If you do not have a doctor in Slovakia, you should contact your nearest regional Public Health Authority for advice on how to have one assigned to you.
<br>
Ending your self-isolation depends on where you have arrived from:
•    If you arrive from or have visited exclusively the UK, EU countries, Iceland, Norway, Liechtenstein or Switzerland in the last 14 days you can end your self-isolation immediately upon receipt of a negative result from your official PCR test, as above. If you did not get tested and show no symptoms of Covid-19, your self-isolation ends automatically after 14 days.
•    If you arrive from or have visited countries other than those named above in the last 14 days you can only end your self-isolation by receiving a negative test result. 
There are certain narrow exemptions to the requirement to self-isolate for the full 14-days:
Cross-border commuters may avoid self-isolation if they can show a negative antigen or PCR test result not older than 7 days and evidence of the reason for their commute.
Freight crews, funeral services employees, critical infrastructure employees, people in need of treatment or diagnosis abroad and sports teams going to competitions do not need to self-isolate provided they meet the conditions for these categories, as set out in the Slovak government’s legislation.
Some travellers can shorten their self-isolation if they meet the following criteria: they must be residents of the UK, EU countries, Norway, Liechtenstein, Switzerland, or Iceland who are travelling between these countries and Slovakia for the purpose of work; or if they are citizens of the UK, EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Lichtenstein with residence in Slovakia and can show evidence that they have recovered from COVID-19 in the past 3 months; or if they can show evidence that they have received the second dose of COVID-19 vaccine more than 14 days previously (regardless of where they work or are resident). In order to qualify for this exemption, these groups must additionally follow the following steps:
•    show at the border a negative PCR test no older than 72 hours or a negative antigen test no older than 48 hours,
•    register in advance of travel on the Slovak government’s website,
•    enter self-isolation, which they can end as soon as they receive a negative PCR test carried out by a private laboratory in Slovakia at their own expense.
